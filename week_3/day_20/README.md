## Day 20

day_20.cpp contains my original implementation with a clever factor finding algorithm which recognises that every factor found comes in a pair (i & x/i). day_20v2.cpp is written using the pseudocode presented in the solutions page for [AoC 2015 day 20](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/3xjpp2/day_20_solutions/cy59zd9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

v2 is a much faster implementation (around 10x) which sacrifices more memory usage for a more efficient algorithm.
